%In this directory, you will find some example data, which is a 300x8
%array stored in a .mat file. Image these are measurements for 300 genes are 8 different time
%points

%1. Use matlab to perform pca on this data, getting the transformation
%matrix, the transformed data, and the eigenvalues.

%2. Look at the eigenvalues - how many dimensions are necessary to explain
%the data? 

%3. Using kmeans clustering to cluster the data into 3 clusters. 
% Make a plot of the first coordinate of the raw data vs the second color coded
% by which cluster it is in. Make the same plot but use the first two
% principle components instead. 

%4. Repeat part 3 but use 7 clusters. Which is a more appropriate number of
%clusters for the data?
